* idea amazon
waterfall model ----> take 6  months of time

for faster deployement

DEPLOYMENT - Application  running on server or datacenter

==> by end to end automation we can do deployment in minutes
privious approch

build tam - (2 days)
test team - (2 days)
production - (3 days)

in waterfall model BUild team has no automation tool so tey take more time.

==> by end to end automation 

developer pushed --> build --> test --> mail

* benefit - no manual in tervention , we dont need to wait for anyone
this type of end to end automation called continuos intergration
